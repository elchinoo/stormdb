- **25% Write Operations**: Orders, reviews, inventory updates
- **Realistic Production Load**: Balanced workload simulating real e-commerce traffic

### Read Mode (ecommerce_read)
- **Product Catalog Browsing**: Category-based product searches
- **User Account Queries**: Order history, profile information
- **Analytics Queries**: Sales reports, inventory status
- **Vector Searches**: Review similarity and recommendations

### Write Mode (ecommerce_write)
- **Order Processing**: New orders with multiple items
- **Inventory Updates**: Stock level changes and adjustments
- **Review Submissions**: Product reviews with vector embeddings
- **Purchase Orders**: Vendor ordering and receipt processing

### Analytics Mode (ecommerce_analytics)

- **Low Latency**: Optimized for transactional workloads

## Automated Stock Control

### Trigger-Based Automation
The workload includes PostgreSQL triggers that automatically:

1. **Monitor Inventory Levels**: Check stock against reorder thresholds
2. **Generate Purchase Orders**: Create orders to vendors when stock is low
3. **Update Costs and Prices**: Adjust selling prices when vendor costs change
4. **Process Receipts**: Update inventory when purchase orders are received

### Cost and Pricing Logic
- **Automatic Price Updates**: When vendor costs increase, selling prices adjust automatically
- **Profit Margin Protection**: Ensures minimum 60% markup on all products
- **Cost Tracking**: Maintains historical cost data for analysis

### Purchase Order Workflow
1. **Low Stock Detection**: Trigger fires when quantity ‚â§ reorder_level
2. **Vendor Selection**: Uses existing supplier relationships
3. **Order Generation**: Creates purchase order with optimal quantity
4. **Receipt Processing**: Updates inventory when goods are received
5. **Cost Analysis**: Adjusts product pricing if costs have changed

## Vector Search Integration

### pgvector Support
- **Review Embeddings**: 1536-dimensional vectors (OpenAI embedding size)
- **Similarity Search**: Cosine similarity for content matching
- **Indexing**: IVFFlat index for efficient vector queries
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to text search when pgvector unavailable

### Vector Operations
```sql
-- Find similar reviews
SELECT review_id, content, rating,
       content_vector <-> $1::vector AS distance
FROM reviews 
WHERE content_vector IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY content_vector <-> $1::vector
LIMIT 10;
```

## Configuration Examples

### Basic E-Commerce Mixed Workload
```yaml
host: "localhost"
port: 5432

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **PostgreSQL 12+**: Database server
2. **pgvector Extension**: Optional for vector features
3. **Go 1.19+**: For building from source

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build the application
go build -o stormdb ./cmd/stormdb

# Run mixed workload demo
./stormdb -config=./config/config_ecommerce_mixed.yaml

# Run interactive demo
./demo_ecommerce_workload.sh
```

### Schema Setup
The workload automatically:
1. Creates all required tables and indexes
2. Sets up stock control triggers and functions
3. Loads realistic sample data based on scale factor
4. Enables pgvector extension if available

## Sample Queries

### Customer Analysis
```sql
-- Customer segmentation
WITH customer_metrics AS (
  SELECT u.user_id, COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
         SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
  FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
  GROUP BY u.user_id
)
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN order_count = 0 THEN 'Inactive'
    WHEN total_spent > 1000 THEN 'VIP'
    ELSE 'Regular'
  END as segment,
  COUNT(*) as customer_count
FROM customer_metrics
GROUP BY 1;
```

### Inventory Analysis
```sql
-- Stock control report
SELECT p.name, i.quantity_available, i.reorder_level,
       v.vendor_name, po.status as po_status
FROM inventory i
JOIN products p ON i.product_id = p.product_id
LEFT JOIN vendors v ON i.supplier_id = v.vendor_id
LEFT JOIN purchase_orders po ON po.vendor_id = v.vendor_id
WHERE i.quantity_available <= i.reorder_level
ORDER BY i.quantity_available ASC;
```

### Vector Similarity
```sql
-- Find similar product reviews
SELECT r1.content, r2.content,
       r1.content_vector <-> r2.content_vector as similarity
FROM reviews r1, reviews r2
WHERE r1.review_id != r2.review_id
   AND r1.content_vector IS NOT NULL
   AND r2.content_vector IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY similarity ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Migration from RealWorld

The E-Commerce workload is a complete replacement for the previous "realworld" workload with the following improvements:

### Enhanced Features
- **Vendor Management**: Complete supplier relationship tracking
- **Automated Stock Control**: Intelligent reordering system
- **Vector Search**: Advanced similarity matching capabilities
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Enhanced reporting and segmentation

### Schema Changes
- **Added Tables**: vendors, purchase_orders, purchase_order_items
- **Enhanced Columns**: Vector columns, margin tracking, automated flags
- **New Indexes**: Vector indexes, composite performance indexes
- **Triggers**: Automated stock control and pricing triggers

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing "realworld" configurations continue to work
- New "ecommerce" configurations provide enhanced functionality
- Gradual migration path available through configuration updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### pgvector Not Available
```
Warning: pgvector extension not available, review vectors will be disabled
```
**Solution**: Install pgvector extension or ignore warning for text-only search

#### Stock Control Triggers Failed
```
Warning: Failed to create stock control triggers
```
**Solution**: Check PostgreSQL permissions for creating functions and triggers

#### Connection Issues
```
Error: failed to connect to database
```
**Solution**: Verify database configuration and network connectivity

### Performance Tuning

#### High Latency
- Increase connection pool size
- Check index usage with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Consider partitioning for large datasets

#### Memory Usage
- Adjust vector index parameters
- Optimize query complexity
- Consider connection pooling configuration
