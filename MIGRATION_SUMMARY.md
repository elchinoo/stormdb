# Workload Plugin Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated all built-in workloads to the plugin system for better modularity, maintainability, and extensibility. Completed full cleanup of deprecated components.

## Migration Completed

### ✅ New Plugins Created
All built-in workloads have been converted to dedicated plugins:

1. **`tpcc_plugin.so`** - TPC-C benchmark workload
   - Handles: `workload: "tpcc"`
   - Location: `plugins/tpcc_plugin/`
   - Self-contained: Complete TPCC implementation included

2. **`simple_plugin.so`** - Basic CRUD operations
   - Handles: `workload: "simple"`, `"read"`, `"write"`, `"mixed"`
   - Location: `plugins/simple_plugin/`
   - Self-contained: Complete Simple workload implementation included

3. **`connection_plugin.so`** - Connection overhead testing
   - Handles: `workload: "connection"`, `"simple_connection"`
   - Location: `plugins/connection_plugin/`
   - Self-contained: Complete Connection workload implementation included

4. **`bulk_insert_plugin.so`** - High-throughput bulk operations
   - Handles: `workload: "bulk_insert"`
   - Location: `plugins/bulk_insert_plugin/`
   - Self-contained: Complete Bulk Insert implementation included

### ✅ Infrastructure Updated

1. **Plugin Build System**
   - Updated `plugins/Makefile` with build targets for all new plugins
   - Added dependency management, testing, and formatting for new plugins
   - Fixed build paths to ensure plugins are created in `build/plugins/`

2. **Builtin Adapter Removed**
   - `pkg/plugin/builtin.go` completely removed
   - `internal/workload/factory.go` updated to use plugin-only architecture
   - Old workload directories completely removed
   - Related tests updated to remove builtin plugin dependencies

3. **Complete Plugin Independence**
   - All workload implementations moved into their respective plugins
   - No more dependencies on `internal/workload/*` packages
   - Each plugin is completely self-contained and independent
   - Eliminated code duplication and potential conflicts

3. **Configuration Compatibility**
   - All existing configuration files continue to work unchanged
   - Plugin system automatically loads appropriate plugins based on workload type
   - No breaking changes to user configurations

### ✅ Cleanup Completed

1. **Deprecated Files Removed**
   - `pkg/plugin/builtin.go` - Deprecated builtin adapter
   - `test/plugin_system_demo.go.disabled` - Obsolete demo file
   - `config/config_backup/` - Duplicate configuration files
   - Old binary artifacts and test results

2. **Old Workload Implementations Removed**
   - `internal/workload/tpcc/` - Moved to `tpcc_plugin/`
   - `internal/workload/simple/` - Moved to `simple_plugin/`
   - `internal/workload/simple_connection/` - Moved to `connection_plugin/`
   - `internal/workload/bulk_insert/` - Moved to `bulk_insert_plugin/`
   - Total: 13 files eliminated, no more duplicate code

3. **Code Modernization**
   - Factory pattern now uses plugin-only architecture
   - Removed all references to deprecated builtin adapter
   - Simplified plugin discovery and loading
   - Updated tests to focus on plugin system
   - Each plugin is now completely independent

## Build & Usage

### Building All Plugins
```bash
cd plugins
make all
```

### Building Individual Plugins
```bash
cd plugins
make tpcc         # Build TPC-C plugin
make simple       # Build Simple workload plugin
make connection   # Build Connection overhead plugin
make bulk_insert  # Build Bulk insert plugin
```

### Using Plugins
Plugins are automatically discovered and loaded from:
- `./plugins/`
- `./build/plugins/` 
- `/usr/local/lib/stormdb/plugins`

No configuration changes needed - existing YAML files work as-is:
```yaml
# This will now use simple_plugin.so instead of builtin adapter
workload: "simple"

# Plugin system configuration (automatically configured)
plugins:
  paths:
    - "./plugins"
    - "./build/plugins"
  auto_load: true
```

## Architecture Benefits

### Before Migration
- All workloads tightly coupled to main binary
- Changes required full rebuild
- Limited extensibility
- Memory overhead from unused workloads
- Deprecated builtin adapter complexity

### After Migration  
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Independent plugin development
- ✅ Dynamic loading/unloading
- ✅ Reduced memory footprint
- ✅ Better testability
- ✅ Easier contribution workflow
- ✅ Simplified codebase without deprecated components

## Plugin Development
Each plugin follows the standard structure:
```
{workload}_plugin/
├── go.mod              # Independent module
├── main.go             # Plugin entry point with WorkloadPlugin interface
├── README.md           # Plugin-specific documentation
└── {workload}.go       # Workload-specific wrapper (optional)
```

All plugins implement the `WorkloadPlugin` interface:
- `GetName()` - Plugin identification
- `GetVersion()` - Version info
- `GetDescription()` - Plugin description
- `GetSupportedWorkloads()` - Workload types handled
- `CreateWorkload(type)` - Factory method
- `Initialize()` - Setup logic
- `Cleanup()` - Teardown logic

## Testing
```bash
# Test all plugins
cd plugins && make test

# Verify plugin builds
cd plugins && make all

# Check dependencies
cd plugins && make deps-check

# Run unit tests
go test ./test/unit -v

# Validate plugin loading (should show no errors about workload creation)
./build/stormdb --config config/workload_simple.yaml --host nonexistent-host --duration 1s
```

## Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing configurations work unchanged
- ✅ All workload types still supported
- ✅ Command-line interfaces identical
- ✅ No breaking changes to user workflows

The migration maintains full backward compatibility while providing a foundation for future plugin-based extensibility and eliminates deprecated components for a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
